# Squabble
1027 assignment 2
Squabble is an interesting word game in existence, and it has a few special features that make
this game the preferred one in the race. The rules are easy, it gives players six chances to
guess a randomly selected five-letter word. You can enter a total of six words, meaning you can
enter five burner words from which you can learn hints about the letters and their placements.
Each letter in your guess is labeled with respect to a mystery word as a correct letter, a used
letter, or an unused letter. For instance, if the mystery word was “ADULT” but your guess was
“AGENT”, then the labelling would be as follows: A correct, G unused, E unused, N unused, and
T correct. That information can inform the next guess. Each subsequent guess helps narrow
down what the mystery word could be. Although much thought was put into these game rules,
our tools will to be less constrained to broaden the possibilities. For example, both length of
word and number of guesses will be arbitrary. Along with lifting these numerical constraints, we
are going to lift textual constraints in our tools to allow different letters other than A-Z. In
particular, the tools will be able to deal with characters other than A-Z allowing for more variants
for a Squabble-esque game. We retain the idea of labelling a words’ letters according to a
mystery word.
